It was a time well before the introduction of labour saving, motor powered, semi automated pipe threading equipment for field use b y HVACR mechanics. Such hand powered and operated equipment as shown here would be the precursors of much to come, heralding a period of industrial, social cultural and economic change [see below].</p><h5 id="industrial-significance">Industrial Significance:</h5><p>This hand powered, arduous pipe threading tool of the 1920’s would be a precursors of much to come. The era of the self powered [electric and pneumatic], self seeking, self regulating and thence fully automated hand tool was still close to half a century in the future for most HVACR field workers - represented, for example, by the electric motor driven, self starting and positioning, power pipe threader, popularly available and affordable for much of the trade by the late 1950’s . But paradoxically, with the evolution of self powered, self regulating and fully automated hand tools would come a significant shift in the skill and knowledge base of HVACR field workers. Many earlier hand skills would be lost, associated with the ‘craftsmanship’ of an earlier period, to be replaced with a focus on labour and time saving and needed economies in installation and service operations in order to reduce consumer costs maintain a competitive edge.<br>The development of international machine and equipment standards was truly one of the wonders of the period. But, these are stories largely untold - except as evident in such equipment as shown here. A prerequisite to the development of thread cutting dies, for example, was the standardization of pipe sizes, threads and allowable tolerances.<br>Here a mixture of apparently interchangeable dies, by GTD and Reed make the point. Early machinery and supply company catalogues further suggest the remarkable degree of standardization that had been achieved in the period [see Reference 1]. But the pressure was on for the development of industry machine standards and practices, for the pending consumer market potential was seen to be immense and engineers, innovators and financiers of the period knew it. A substantial machine and tool industry would quickly evolve after W.W.II to support the HVACR installation and service industry. The home service trades grew rapidly during this pre W.W.II period and on into the 1950’s, plumber, electrician, heating and refrigeration. The new, technology-based service trades brought with them a new, quite different breed of industrial service worker, mobile, entrepreneurial, and skilled in the new consumer technologies then available for the Canadian home.</p><h5 id="socio-economic-significance">Socio-economic Significance:</h5><h5 id="socio-cultural-significance">Socio-cultural Significance:</h5><p>With the evolution of self powered, self seeking, self regulating and thence semi and fully automated hand tools, greatly accelerated by W.W.II developments, would come a significant shift in much of the Canada’s socio-cultural infrastructure: For example, the evolution of formal systems for vocational education and technical skill training in Canada [e.g., apprenticeship], would be required to support the technology-based service trades. The evolution of formal vocational skill and technical training in Canada would mirror a movement by then well established throughout much of the Western world [ See References 2 and 3] Following skill training experience in W.W.II, the mid 20th century would see the emergence of the fields of ‘human factors’, systems and the ‘psychology of human learning’, to help provide much needed understandings of conditions for the effective learning of sophisticated motor, cognitive and affective technical and trade skills.
