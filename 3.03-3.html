It was, in fact, recognized even by the late 1920’s that the refrigerator in the kitchen was much more than a mere technology of practical advantage, in matters of convenience, health and hygiene (see references below).</p><p>The home refrigerator was, above all, to be promoted as an “experiential” technology, one allowing and facilitating a whole new range of human experience. The household refrigerator brought with it into the home many new cultural meanings to be explored by the family. There to be explored were: 1. new tastes, 2. greater range of foods and gastronomic experiences, 3. potential for creative and elaborated menus, and 4.new opportunities and challenges for the home maker in caring for family [see illustrations in references below].</p><h5 id="market-price">Market Price:</h5><h5 id="technological-significance">Technological Significance:</h5><h5 id="industrial-significance">Industrial Significance:</h5><p>By the early 1930’s, the refrigeration industry, recognizing the potential of beverage cooling, as an area of speciality, in a then rapidly growing industry, spawned a number of speciality companies, in order to take advantage of what appeared to be a lucrative market segment.</p><p>In the early 1930’s,Temprite beverage coolers, manufactured by the Liquid Cooler Corporation, Detroit Mich, became a recognised market leader, an amazing range of specialised products quickly followed [See bibliographic references below].</p><p>Among the applications promoted by Temprite were: water coolers for office buildings, offices, hotels, restaurants, factories, hospitals, apartment houses, and barbershops for cold towels, cooling brine for circulation in fur storage refrigerators</p><h5 id="socio-economic-significance">Socio-economic Significance:</h5><p>Theme: The Use of Hyperbola in Appealing to Canadian Values and Perceived Needs starting in the 1920’s ‘ Amid the relative hardship and austerity of the pioneer and early settlement conditions prevailing across Canada in the 1920’s, the refrigerator in the Canadian home would soon take on special cultural and social meaning and significance (see 1, above). And the inventors, engineers and manufacturers of the period knew it and made best use of the fact to promote their wares.</p><pre><code>   Hyperbola (exaggeration for the purposes of effect) has always been a principle strategy for the selling of consumer products and progressively shaping a culture of consumption. The many aspects of a product, which were assumed to be of value to the consumer, were thus made the subject of exaggeration, a technique apparently well developed as early as 1929 (ref. p. 1314).

   Hyperbola, much more than true utility and advantage of what was being hyped, would quickly become the principal driving force of Canada&#39;s consumer cultural revolution.  The changes associated with the explosion of popular technology and its vastly accelerated rate of consumption would soon quickly alter Canadian popular culture and society. 

   Selling mechanical refrigeration  equipment was done through appeal to: 1)  health, safety and hygiene, 2)  fragileness, 3)  improved comfort conditions, 4)  life style alternatives, 5)  quality, 6)  durability, 7)  efficiency, 8) meeting needs for a more visually pleasing home, including the appeal to &quot;modern&quot; styling and aesthetics, and  9) appeal to the novel, to features as needed functionality, and to functionality as convenience and implied utility [see references below]
