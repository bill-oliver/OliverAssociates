The high side float refrigerant metering system enjoyed a flurry of excitement in the mid 1930’s - easier to calibrate and more robust than its cousin, the low side float. Both would soon give way, however, to more compact automatic, less costly and more reliable expansion valve engineering, designed for cabinet refrigerator market. Ultimately with the advent of hermetic system refrigeration technology to calibrated capillary line, evaporator refrigerants flow control would come to prevail.

Located on the north slopes of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within 20 miles of Toronto, the County would also attract early ex-urban development, to be come a wealthy market place for the emerging household and consumer technologies of the early and mid 20th century.</p><p>This artifact was discovered in the 1950’s in the used stock of T.

The float opens the valve at a predetermined level of refrigerant in the receiver, as it is returned from the high side of the compressor. The system is subject to critical refrigerant charge, much like the capillary tube device to follow. However maintaining the critical charge necessary for trouble free operation in open type condensing units, subject to compressor seal and other leaks was always a challenge.</p><h5 id="industrial-significance">Industrial Significance:</h5><p>The high side float refrigerant meter system, used for flooded evaporators, was the source of some engineering interest and production in the mid 1930’s, but was then largely abandoned, along with the low side float, for the mainstream of household and small commercial refrigeration applications - for reasons of cost, reliability and serviceability and the engineering design constraints it introduced. By this time much simpler trouble free metering technology was at hand.</p><h5 id="socio-economic-significance">Socio-economic Significance:</h5><h5 id="socio-cultural-significance">Socio-cultural Significance:</h5><p>It was a period in which machinery in the home was often not at all welcome, being viewed with the suspicion that comes with novelty. Machinery belonged on the farm and on the factory floor, but not in the Canadian home. Here it was considered noisy and hazardous, a potential threat to personal and private property. The mere notion of a self regulating, mechanical device that could be trusted to stop and start and self regulate itself reliably, over long periods of time was simply not part of popular experience of ordinary Canadians of the time. Thus, in addition to the immense array technical problems which remained to resolved, there was an equally large array of socio- cultural challenges to be over come by manufactures in convincing their public to be early adopters of refrigeration technology in the home - in the face of massive mistrust and apprehension. Conversely however, for those that were in a financial position of enjoying the many benefits of the technology, there were multiple factors tending to attract advocates and early adopters. Included were: the human need to be recognized as an early leader in adoption, the need for socio-economic status in the community, as well as the allure of new taste sensations, a break with the overwhelming, often desperate boredom of the daily dietary offerings of the period.</p><h5 id="donor">Donor:</h5><p>G.
