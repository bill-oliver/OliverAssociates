Located on the north slopes of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within 20 miles of Toronto, the County would also attract early ex-urban development, to become a wealthy market place for the emerging household and consumer technologies of the early and mid 20th century.</p><p>This artifact was discovered in the 1950’s in the used stock of T.

The FHP induction motor, for the most part, would have only two moving parts, as it evolved through the 1930 to 60’s, its starting mechanism and its bearing structure. It was a period before advances in metallurgy and applications engineering made the long life, sleeve bearing a reality [See Reference 1]. Both starting mechanisms and bearings were subject to rapid wear and often early failure. The engineering, maintenance and repair of both were critical to the performance and reliability of HVACR equipment in both household and commercial applications.</p><h5 id="industrial-significance">Industrial Significance:</h5><p>The Snap-On, Blue-Point metal case, with blue wrinkled enamel finish, and stylish company logo in red and white is an industrial design icon of the period. Gone was the heavy, hand crafted, oak case, preferred by the market of a decade or so earlier, to be replaced by a much slicker, streamlined and modern look preferred by Canada’s post W.W.II economy and culture [See ID # 342, 16.07-10].<br>The well equipped HVACR repair and rebuilding shop of the time would be one well equipped to replace, refit and re-machine electric motor bearings, employing hand fitting and reaming equipment [See also ID No, 341, 16.07-9, and 343, 16.07-11]. The arrival in the market place of the alignment reamer, custom made for the FHP electric motor repair industry was, in itself, a marker of some significance. What it marked was the size of the motor repair sector of the times, and the market opportunities presented, in meeting the tooling needs of HVACR repair industry.<br>In hindsight, it was with a certain irony that the long pattern, hand, alignment reamer would be welcomed into the life of the HVACR mechanic. For while it marked a major step forward in dealing with bearing failures of the time, it also marked the end of an era. As the 1950’s came to an end, three factors would converge to dramatically restructure the HVACR service industry: The hermetic motor compressor would, within a few short years, come to dominate in the field of household and commercial refrigeration applications, effectively mitigating the need for the open, belt driven refrigeration system;<br>For other applications the evolution of new metallurgy and bearing designs would yield bearing structures whose life expectancy could be measured in decades rather than months and years; and Constantly rising labour costs, coupled with reduced production costs would spell the end to much of the FHP electric motor repair industry. The HVACR service technician would become much more of a diagnostician and replacement technician than a repairman.</p><h5 id="socio-economic-significance">Socio-economic Significance:</h5><h5 id="socio-cultural-significance">Socio-cultural Significance:</h5><h5 id="donor">Donor:</h5><p>G.
