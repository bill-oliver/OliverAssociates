A kind of idyllic, mystical place and time, one which faded in the mist of time, over-taken by realities life and times. While that may well be HHCC’s fate, it’s not the one envisaged here.  For there is nothing mystical in its unique and distinguishing characteristics, business model, stock-in-trade, and accomplishments – all carefully planned and generated over close to 20 years, exploring what 21<sup>st</sup> century times require of us.</p><hr><p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2"></a> <a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[9]</a> Warehouse facilities are currently limited to close pack [container storage], awaiting development of new facilities [See images of warehouse facilities, the “Centre At Work”, Attachment A.
